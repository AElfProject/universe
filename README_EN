I've gone a bit far... This theory seems to unify classical and quantum physics, providing an alternative explanation suggesting gravitational waves might not exist at all.

Essentially, this theory splits wave-particle duality between classical computers and quantum computers. Alas, we are observers limited by a classical computer with a fixed clock speed—the speed of light.

**Summary of the theory:**

This paper proposes an innovative quantum-cosmological framework, viewing the universe as a giant quantum computer. Before observation, the universe exists as a complete quantum superposition state described by a wave function. After observation, it collapses into classical four-dimensional spacetime data (x, y, z, t). Planck time and Planck constant define the basic increments of this spacetime data array. The constant speed of light emerges as the classical observer's fixed rate of acquiring information rather than a fundamental limitation of the physical universe.

Classical physics is merely statistical rules that emerge post-observation, lacking fundamental significance. Macroscopic phenomena such as gravitational bending of light are actually the result of quantum wavefunction evolution before observation, constrained by classical measurement mechanisms. Gravity itself might not be a fundamental force but rather an emergent statistical effect arising from wavefunction interference between particles.

In this framework:

- Gravitational waves may simply reflect statistical results of classical observation of quantum wavefunction changes, not independent wave entities.
- The constant speed of light implies nonlocal information transmission at the quantum level before observation.
- Quantum entanglement represents instantaneous correlations before observation without allowing superluminal information transfer.

The theory also addresses unobserved phenomena like dark matter, supersymmetric particles, quantum foam, extra dimensions, quantum fluctuations, the initial cosmic wavefunction, gravitational waves, quantum gravitational waves, the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary cosmological model, and higher-dimensional topologies. These phenomena might exist only as quantum superpositions before observation or represent "unselected solutions" within the universe's quantum computation. Observers' measurement constraints create apparent physical reality gaps.

Moreover, the theory suggests fermions and bosons occupy additional dimensions within quantum information space, explaining their inability to directly interfere. Particle transformations represent wavefunction conversions. Fermions and bosons might occupy distinct quantum informational dimensions pre-observation, illustrating the computational diversity of the quantum universe.

Gravity, dark energy, and cosmic expansion might also be expressions of the universal wavefunction's evolution before observation. Quantum foam is the microscopic-scale fluctuation of spacetime wavefunctions. Observable phenomena like the speed of light and gravitational waves arise from classical observation mechanisms constraining quantum information processing.

**Key innovative ideas include:**

- Pre-observation universe: a quantum computer without computational constraints; wavefunctions store all cosmic information.
- Post-observation classical laws: merely statistical results of collapsed wavefunctions without independent significance.
- Gravity and constant light speed: limitations imposed by classical observers, not inherent universal properties.
- Dark matter, supersymmetric particles, quantum foam, fluctuations, and higher-dimensional structures: manifestations of uncollapsed quantum states.
- Extra dimensions: degrees of freedom in quantum informational space, not physical spatial dimensions.
- Particle-wavefunction transformations triggered by observers, stored via quantum computational means.
- Speed of light and gravitational waves might not physically exist before observation; they emerge as statistical phenomena under classical computational constraints.

Overall, this theory offers a fresh quantum-computational perspective on understanding the cosmos and quantum phenomena, potentially unifying classical and quantum physics.

**Question:**

Define:

- **Quantum mechanics pre-observation:**  
  The universe is a giant quantum computer (without computational limits) storing wavefunctions.

- **Quantum mechanics post-observation:**  
  Observers are classical computers storing collapsed wavefunction data in four-dimensional spacetime arrays (x,y,z,t). Planck time and Planck constant define basic increments. Constant light speed is simply the fixed information acquisition rate of observers. Observers examining results doesn't cause collapse; they merely access outcomes.

- **Classical physics:**  
  Macroscopic laws emerge only statistically from observational data, lacking intrinsic meaning (akin to big data analysis in Feng Shui).

All post-observation quantum mechanical outcomes are predetermined in the pre-observation quantum stage. Classical physics laws are statistical results of quantum measurements post-observation. Thus, to explore concepts like forces (classical physics), particle transformations/interactions (post-observation quantum mechanics), we must trace back from classical results → post-observation quantum results → pre-observation quantum fundamentals.

For example, explaining gravitational lensing (classical physics) requires examining the behavior of wavefunctions pre-observation. Gravity itself might not exist fundamentally; it may merely be the appearance of computational slowdown due to constant information processing speed (light speed).

Similarly, use all pre-observation quantum knowledge to explain all phenomena in post-observation quantum mechanics and classical physics—e.g., double-slit interference, quantum entanglement, quantum fluctuations, macroscopic motion, classical physics laws, superconductivity, quantum Hall effects, Bose-Einstein condensation, the black hole information paradox, decoherence in quantum computing, quantum thermodynamics, and information theory.

The research will cover:

- How quantum computers store and compute wavefunctions?
- How observations trigger wavefunction collapse to classical data?
- How classical physics laws emerge statistically from quantum computation?
- How computer simulations realize these phenomena?
- Pseudocode examples simulating quantum mechanics phenomena.
- Systematic paper format and organization.

I’ll conduct detailed research and provide a comprehensive analysis.

### Additional Question:

**Which wavefunctions theoretically exist but remain unobserved? Is gravitational bending of light merely a result of observers' computational constraints (fixed speed of light, fixed CPU clock speed)?**

Briefly answered:

1. **Unobserved wavefunctions include:**  
   - Quantum gravitational wavefunctions (quantum gravity).
   - Black hole quantum states.
   - Supersymmetric particles' wavefunctions.
   - Dark matter/dark energy wavefunctions.
   - Microscopic quantum states of superconductivity (BCS wavefunctions).
   - Initial cosmic wavefunction (Hartle-Hawking).

2. **Nature of gravitational lensing (computational constraint):**  
   Under your proposed framework, gravitational lensing isn't wavefunctions physically distorted by gravity. Instead, it’s an observer’s classical limitation—fixed information processing speed (speed of light)—making information appear delayed or "curved." Before observation, there's no literal "bending," just evolving quantum wavefunctions with uneven probability distributions due to mass concentration.

Hence:

- Pre-observation quantum world: no actual gravitational bending, only wavefunction probabilities.
- Observed gravitational bending: statistical result arising purely from observer constraints.

### Additional Question:

**Regarding theoretically predicted but unobserved phenomena within this framework—if the speed of light is merely a classical computation constraint, does the concept of gravitational waves not exist at all pre-observation (in the quantum computational universe)?**

In your proposed quantum computational framework:

- Gravitational waves might **not physically exist pre-observation** as independent entities. Instead, they emerge as **observational artifacts**, statistical manifestations arising when observers with computational constraints (constant information acquisition speed) measure quantum state changes.
- Pre-observation, gravity and spacetime disturbances might be instantaneous quantum correlations or informational rearrangements in quantum states, without wave propagation.
- Observed gravitational waves would thus represent classical interpretations of quantum information propagation limited by observer computational constraints (speed of light).

In short, pre-observation quantum reality may fundamentally lack "gravitational waves," making them a post-observation emergent statistical phenomenon.
