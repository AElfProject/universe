## 双缝实验的人类理解 | Human understanding of double-slit experiment

双缝实验是量子力学中最具标志性的实验之一，它展示了粒子的波粒二象性。人类观测者在这一实验中的角色尤为重要，因为观测行为本身会改变实验结果，这一现象挑战了我们对物理现实的传统理解。

The double-slit experiment is one of the most iconic experiments in quantum mechanics, demonstrating the wave-particle duality of particles. The role of the human observer in this experiment is particularly important, as the act of observation itself changes the experimental results, challenging our traditional understanding of physical reality.

## 延迟选择实验的认知影响 | Cognitive impact of delayed choice experiments

延迟选择实验进一步挑战了我们的时间和因果概念，暗示过去的事件似乎可以被未来的选择所影响。这种反直觉的现象对人类认知产生了深远的影响，迫使我们重新思考时间、因果和决定论的本质。

Delayed choice experiments further challenge our concepts of time and causality, suggesting that past events can seemingly be influenced by future choices. This counterintuitive phenomenon has profound implications for human cognition, forcing us to rethink the nature of time, causality, and determinism.

## 量子纠缠的概念挑战 | Conceptual challenges of quantum entanglement

量子纠缠现象挑战了局域性原理，表明远距离分离的粒子可以瞬时相互影响。这一现象不仅难以用经典物理解释，也对人类的空间和连接性概念提出了根本性的挑战。

The phenomenon of quantum entanglement challenges the principle of locality, indicating that particles separated by large distances can instantaneously influence each other. This phenomenon is not only difficult to explain using classical physics but also poses fundamental challenges to human concepts of space and connectivity.
