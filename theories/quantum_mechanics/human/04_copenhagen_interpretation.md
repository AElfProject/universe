# 哥本哈根诠释视角 | Copenhagen Interpretation Perspective

## 观测者的特殊地位 | Special status of the observer

在哥本哈根诠释中，观测者被赋予了特殊的地位。波函数坍缩被认为是由测量过程引起的，而人类观测者在这一过程中扮演着关键角色，将量子的可能性转变为经典的确定性。

In the Copenhagen interpretation, the observer is given a special status. Wave function collapse is considered to be caused by the measurement process, and the human observer plays a key role in this process, transforming quantum possibilities into classical certainties.

## 经典与量子世界的分界 | Boundary between classical and quantum worlds

哥本哈根诠释提出了经典世界与量子世界之间存在一条分界线。这条分界线的位置与观测者的角色密切相关，引发了关于宏观与微观、主观与客观之间关系的深刻思考。

The Copenhagen interpretation proposes that there is a boundary between the classical world and the quantum world. The position of this boundary is closely related to the role of the observer, prompting profound reflections on the relationship between the macroscopic and microscopic, the subjective and the objective.

## 互补原理的认知基础 | Cognitive basis of complementarity principle

玻尔的互补原理表明，量子系统可以表现出互相排斥但又互相补充的特性，如波动性和粒子性。这一原理不仅是物理现象的描述，也反映了人类认知的基本限制和结构。

Bohr's complementarity principle suggests that quantum systems can exhibit mutually exclusive but complementary properties, such as wave-like and particle-like behavior. This principle is not only a description of physical phenomena but also reflects the fundamental limitations and structures of human cognition.
